# userscripts

Traverse and Babel:  

While using wordproject.org, I found it tedious to go to the top of the page to go to the next or previous chapter. I also found it tedious to change the language by going through various webpages. So I made this userscript to make it easier for me to change languages and traverse chapters of a book of the Bible. 

One can use the left arrow key to go to the previous chapter, and the right arrow key to go to the next chapter. At the highest chapter one can not go to the next book, only backwards; at the lowest chapter, one cannot go the previous book, only forwards.

It also includes a randomizing feature (that can be enabled by setting randomizer = 1) that makes the chapter appear in a random choice between 5 different languages (French, English, Amharic, Spanish, and Portuguese).

As long as wordproject.org exists, and their urls continue to be structured they way they are, this userscript should work.

Possible features to include are the following:

More assortment of languages (can be done by just looking at the 2 letter code used for the many other languages Wordproject.org offers)

Book traversal (going to the next book, previous book)

I don't want my code to become obsolete so hopefully this can become a fully-fledged program on its own, but for now, it is a userscript since they are easier and faster to make.
